# Climatic_Chmaber_PLC
The project involves using two SCADA applications and a Siemens S7-1214 PLC to monitor and control the temperature inside a climate chamber, built from a modified refrigerator and a PTC heater. The system ensures precise temperature regulation for various applications, providing real-time data and control through user-friendly SCADA interfaces.
